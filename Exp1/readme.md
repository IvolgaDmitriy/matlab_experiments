# Simulink Model generation using MATLAB Commands and Functions  
The main task of this example is to create and fill in a .slx file using the MATLAB script. MATLAB has an extensive API (Application Program Interface) for building and modifying Simulink models from MATLAB code. This may be from either the MATLAB command line, from within a function or script, or from anywhere that m-code can be executed.  
  
The primary functions for this:  
+`add_block`  
+`add_line`  
+`set_param`  
  
## Sine Wave Model  
  
  
  
## 2 Bar Mechanism
